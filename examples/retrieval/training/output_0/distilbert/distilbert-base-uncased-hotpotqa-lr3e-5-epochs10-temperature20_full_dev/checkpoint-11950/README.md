Sibrel is a critic of the Apollo program and proponent of the conspiracy theory that the six Apollo Moon landing missions between 1969 and 1972 were elaborate hoaxes perpetrated by the United States government, including NASA.</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The town of Yellowknife did not exist yet at that point, but the discovery of gold at Burwash was the catalyst that brought more gold prospectors into the region in 1935 and 1936. A short shaft was sunk in 1935-1936 at Burwash, and in the summer of 1935 a 16-ton bulk sample of ore was shipped to Trail, British Columbia for processing, yielding 200 troy ounces (6 kg) of gold. The mine did not become a substantial producer and it is believed the gold vein was mined out.</code> |
  | <code>The MKT Nature and Fitness Trail runs nine miles in the right of way of what former Class 1 railroad company that was established in 1865, and had its last headquarters in Dallas?</code> | <code>The Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad (reporting mark MKT) is a former Class I railroad company in the United States, with its last headquarters in Dallas. Established in 1865 under the name Union Pacific Railway, Southern Branch, it came to serve an extensive rail network in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri. In 1988, it merged with the Missouri Pacific Railroad and is now part of Union Pacific Railroad.</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
