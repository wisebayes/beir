## ColBERT Model Evaluation on the BEIR Benchmark

In this script we show how to evaluate the ColBERT zero-shot model on the BEIR Benchmark.
In this example, we show how to modify the original ColBERT repository for evaluation of our BEIR models at the time for reproducibility purposes.
Please follow the required steps to evaluate ColBERT easily across any BEIR dataset.
